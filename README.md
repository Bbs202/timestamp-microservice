Timestamp Microservice
=========================

This project is part of [freeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org)'s backend development certifacation.

##### [Project objective](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice):
>build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/) and deploy it to Glitch. 
>
> Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
>
> - User can pass a string as a url parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
>
> - If it does, the server returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
>
> - If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, server returns null for those properties.
> - In both cases, the response should be a JSON object
